"""
Step 4-5 of the workflow: AI generates a HYPOTHESIS from an uploaded photo,
never a final memory.

DECISION (this session): reverted from the local-Ollama/llava plan back to
Gemini (cloud) as the ONLY vision path. Running a local vision-language
model needs a GPU (or a very patient CPU) that isn't available for this
build, so "offline/local AI" as originally scoped is not realistic here.

Honest tradeoff: this makes photo analysis require internet connectivity.
If "offline support" still needs to be true in your pitch, be explicit that
it now means "reminders/quiz/memory browsing work offline, photo analysis
needs a connection" rather than fully offline AI - don't claim more than
this code does.

Reliability measures given this is now a hard dependency on a 3rd-party
cloud API: a fast timeout (never hang a demo), graceful JSON-parse
fallback, and a safe default hypothesis if Gemini is unreachable or
misconfigured so the rest of the flow (face detection, human review) can
still proceed even if the vision hypothesis comes back empty.
